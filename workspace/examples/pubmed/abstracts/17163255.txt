BACKGROUND: To determine whether concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin has 
any effect on the release and absorption of paracetamol.
METHODS AND DESIGN: Ten healthy female volunteers received a single oral dose of 
paracetamol 1g or paracetamol 1g plus ciprofloxacin 500mg in a double-blind,
crossover study. Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured in salivary samples
using a colorimetric method.
RESULTS: Maximum paracetamol concentration (C(max)) in saliva was significantly
decreased when co-administered with ciprofloxacin (19.50 vs 13.70 microg/mL, p < 
0.05). Time to paracetamol C(max) was significantly increased (1.43h vs 0.77h; p 
< 0.05) and paracetamol half-life was prolonged (1.19 to 1.53h, p = 0.05) in the 
presence of ciprofloxacin, whereas the area under the concentration-time curve
was not affected.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with paracetamol may
result in a delayed onset of action of paracetamol.
