Prepare cmc corpus
	# Set up corpus: 
	copy documents and annotations into corpus_doc tables
	would like to use same format for both i2b2 and cmc corpora
	run data/corpus_doc.sql
	
	# Set up folds: FoldGeneratorImpl on data/corpus.properties.xml
	
	# Set up anno_contain table
	run data/insert_anno_contain.sql
	
	# Try 'Sujeevan' kernel
	in libsvm/sujeevan/beans-corpus-kernel.xml
	doc -> section -> named entities -> concepts
	               -> words
	Use outermost named entities - named entities contained within other named entities

	# Generate concept graph
	Run ConceptDaoImpl on data/corpus.properties.xml
	
	# Store infocontent
	Run InfoContentEvaluatorImpl on data/corpus.properties.xml
	
	# Modified beans-kernel-sim.xml to use placeholders for conceptGraphName and corpusName
	need to verify that this doesn't break anything
