# Semantic Similarity Measures #
Refer to [YTEX Semantic Similarity Measures](http://ytex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/nlm.wsd/doc/YTEX%20Semantic%20Similarity%20Measures.pdf) for a description of the measures used in this study.  Note that the 'Intrinsic Path' similarity measure is another name for 'Jiang & Conrath'.

# Reproducing our results on WSD datasets #
Refer to the [Word Sense Disambiguation Wiki Page](WordSenseDisambiguation_V08#Reproducing_results_on_WSD_datasets.md) for a detailed description of how to reproduce our results.

# Reproducing our results on CMC 2007 challenge #
Refer to the [CMC section of the WSD Wiki Page](WordSenseDisambiguation_V08#Reproducing_results_on_CMC_2007_challenge.md) for a detailed description of how to reproduce our results.

# Supplementary data #
The [results.xlsx](http://ytex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/nlm.wsd/doc/results.xlsx) file contains the following worksheets:
  * all-wsd-results: WSD accuracy for each dataset and parameter combination
  * nlm-model: coefficients & p-values for their significance for the model of WSD accuracy as a linear function of parameters on the NLM WSD dataset
  * msh-model: coefficients & p-values for their significance for the model of WSD accuracy as a linear function of parameters on the MSH WSD dataset
Other worksheets correspond to tables/figures in the main paper.
