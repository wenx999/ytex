Is there an optimal prostate-specific antigen threshold for prostate biopsy?

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remains the best biomarker available for early     
prostate cancer (PCa) detection. Increasing PSA values are associated with         
increasing PCa risk. The traditional PSA cut-off of 4 µg/l was lowered because     
the PCa detection rates are similar in the PSA ranges 2-4 and 4-10 µg/l. This      
approach increases sensitivity, but also lets the numbers of 'insignificant        
cancers' rise. Thus far, the used PSA cut-offs 2.5, 3 or 4 µg/l provide a          
reasonable balance between excessive detection rates and the risk of missing       
relevant PCa. Specificity of PSA has been enhanced by using PSA derivatives, PSA   
isoforms, new biomarkers and multivariate models. PSA should be used               
intelligently and several other factors should be considered for a final biopsy    
decision.
