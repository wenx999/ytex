Findings: AP, lateral and sunrise views of the left knee are compared to previous exam of 
05/07/2011. Accounting for difference in technique, has been no significant interval change in the
appearance of the left knee. Again there is tricompartmental degenerative arthropathy with joint
space narrowing which is worst at the lateral facet of the patellofemoral joint, and 
tricompartmental osteophytes.  There is no significant knee joint effusion.
