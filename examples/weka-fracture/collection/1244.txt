Findings: There is now evidence of a nondisplaced fracture involving the right superior pubic ramus 
close to the symphysis.  There is diffuse osteopenia with a stable old healed right 
intertrochanteric fracture with internal stabilization as well as a left subcapital fracture 
internally stabilized as well. There is an old left ischiopubic junction fracture deformity. Sacrum
and coccyx are mostly obscured by bowel content. There is heavy aorto iliac and branch 
calcification.  
       
Conclusion: Nondisplaced right superior pubic ramus fracture.
