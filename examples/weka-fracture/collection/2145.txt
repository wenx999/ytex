Findings: Multiple images of the right shoulder reveal a full thickness, near full width tear of 
supraspinatus tendon with a few anterior fibers remaining. There is approximately 3 cm retraction 
of the myotendinous junction. In addition, there is a small, articular surface tear of the 
infraspinatus tendon at its insertion with laminar extension into the myotendinous junction.
There is mild fatty atrophy of the supraspinatus and moderate fatty atrophy of the infraspinatus 
muscle. Overall there is diffuse muscular fatty atrophy throughout the shoulder musculature. There 
is superior subluxation of the humeral head. There is increased longitudinal signal and thickening 
of the interarticular portion of the biceps tendon consistent with a split tear. Thickening and 
increased signal of the subscapularis tendon is consistent with tendinopathy.
