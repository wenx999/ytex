Menisci: There is intrasubstance degeneration in the lateral meniscus without discrete tear. There
is complex degeneration of the posterior horn and body of the medial meniscus with extrusion.  
       
Tendons: The quadriceps and patellar tendons are intact.  
       
Ligaments: There is increased signal within it the ACL consistent with degeneration. The PCL, LCL 
and MCL appear intact.  
       
Bone/cartilage: There are tricompartmental degenerative changes. There are extensive degenerative 
changes in the medial compartment with diffuse cartilage loss in the weight bearing region. There 
is moderate thinning of the anterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle cartilage with mild 
heterogeneity. There is heterogeneity of the patellofemoral cartilage.  Note is made of a distil 
femur hairline fracture not previously noted.
