= Prerequisities =
== UMLS Install ==
As documented in [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/help.html MetamorphoSys Help], 
and in [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/scripts/index.html Load Scripts].

== CRAN R ==
Used for statistical analysis (computing spearman correlation)

== SNOMED-CT download ==
  * download and extract SNOMED-CT from http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html (we used 20110731, available from http://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/IHTSDO20110731/SnomedCT_RF2Release_INT_20110731.zip)
  
== MeSH download ==
place all files in ${mesh.home}.  download following files, and extract the zip files to ${mesh.home}:
  * [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/termscon.html desc2012.zip]  (extract desc2012.xml from this file) 
  * [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/termscon.html supp2012.zip]  (extract supp2012.xml from this file) 
  * [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2012/download/desc2012.dtd desc2012.dtd]
  * [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2012/download/supp2012.dtd supp2012.dtd]

= Running the Benchmark =
Setup some properties in ytex, run a couple scripts, and you're done.

== YTEX Properties == 
In YTEX_HOME/config/desc/ytex.properties 
  * set sct.home property to full path of the Snapshot/Terminology directory, and sct.version to the version date.
  * set mesh.home to directory containing desc2012.xml, desc2012.dtd, supp2012.xml, and supp2012.dtd. 
  * set R.bin to directory that contains R executable
{{{
sct.home=E:/temp/SnomedCT_RF2Release_INT_20110731/Snapshot/Terminology
sct.version=20110731
mesh.home=c:/temp/mesh
R.bin=C:/Program Files/R/R-2.13.1/bin/x64
}}}
  
== YTEX Kernel Installation ==
Setup ytex kernel tables and snomed ct tables
{{{
. ${HOME}/ytex.profile
cd ${YTEX_HOME}/data
ant -Dytex.home=${YTEX_HOME} kernel.drop kernel.create sct.all > kernel.out 2>&1 &
}}}

== Sim Benchmark ==
{{{
cd ${YTEX_HOME}
unzip simbenchmark-v0.6.zip
cd simbenchmark
nohup ant -Dytex.home=${YTEX_HOME} all > simbenchmark.out 2>&1 &  
}}}

What this script does (list by ant target):
  * build - build classes needed to parse mesh and load into db
  * mesh.all - load mesh into db
  * cg.all - generate all the concept graphs, compute intrinsic info content and concept depths
  * eval.all - evaluate semantic similarity measures for each concept graph and benchmark, compute spearman correlation
  
When you are finished, you will have the following files:
  * data/<concept graph>/<benchmark>_id.txt has the similarity measures for each concept pair for the given concept graph/benchmark combination.
  * data/spearman.csv has the correlation and p-value for each benchmark/concept graph/measure combination.
  * data/spearman-summary.csv has the same data, but summarized to simplify viewing.
